I recently attended my first game jam, #leetgamejam and after having dabbled a little with PICO-8 before from the recommendation of a friend I decided I would make my first game in this engine.
The result is a multiplayer game which could be described as a mix between achtung die kurve and a boxing game.
The player controls a boxer and can send out each arm individually like a snake, but once the arms are sent out you control the arms rather than the character. The idea is that you need to use both arms strategically to try to attack and defend yourself from the opponent player.

Thanks to @Elastiskalinjen for showing me PICO-8 and providing me with the nice camera shake and particle effect function.
